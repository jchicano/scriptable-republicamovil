# scriptable-republicamovil

Inside the script you must change the `IP` and `PATH` variables to match yours

I am assuming the JSON file has the following format:
```
{
  "min_used": "0",
  "min_available": "150",
  "cel_used": "3.03",
  "cel_available": "3",
  "cel_used_format": "GB",
  "promo_used": "3.00",
  "promo_available": "20",
  "promo_used_format": "MB"
}
```
You can get the API from <a href="https://github.com/jchicano/api-republicamovil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
